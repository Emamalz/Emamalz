## Projects

Student Progression Tracker - Python GUI Application (Software Development I)
- Designed a desktop application using Python and Tkinter to process student credit data and categorise outcomes
(Progress, Trailer, Retriever, Exclude).
- Implemented data validation, automated classification, and histogram visualisation using dynamic rendering.
- Created a comprehensive test plan achieving 100% pass rate on validation and functional tests.

Health Check Voting System - Database-Driven Web Application (Software Engineering Principles & Practice)
- Designed and implemented a relational database in SQLite with Logical ERD and normalised schema.
- Developed high- and low-fidelity UI prototypes for Admin, Team Leader, and User roles using Canva.
- Applied UML modelling and produced sitemaps, storyboards, and interaction diagrams.
- Managed collaborative workflow using Trello, WhatsApp, and Discord following Agile project management practices.

Breast Cancer Patient Data Analysis - Machine Learning Pipeline
- Conducted data preprocessing including missing value handling, categorical encoding, and scaling using Pandas and
NumPy.
- Built classification models (Support Vector Machines with hyperparameter tuning) for cancer stage prediction and
regression models for survival month estimation.
- Evaluated models with accuracy, RMSE, and R^2 metrics, visualising results using Matplotlib.
- Delivered a reproducible ML workflow documented in Jupyter Notebooks.
  
Maximum Flow Algorithm - Algorithms Theory & Design
- Implemented Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm using adjacency list representation in Java for improved memory
efficiency.
- Analysed time complexity (O(V*E^2) worst case, ~O(E*V) for benchmark datasets) and validated results on ladder and
bridge graph test cases.
- Produced well-documented, maintainable code with performance benchmarks and analysis.

Love Ur Living - Web Development & Deployment
- Developed a responsive website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with modern UI principles.
- Deployed on Vercel with a custom domain via Fasthosts, ensuring high availability and optimised load performance.
- Applied cross-device testing to ensure mobile and desktop compatibility.
